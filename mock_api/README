# Mock API Service

This service is intended to be a Mock API service for project demo purposes. This service aims to implement a 
REST API that is a subset of the functionally that would be present in a Professional Services Automation (PSA)
tool leveraged by Managed Service Providers (MSP) such as tools like ConnectWise PSA, Kaseya BMS, etc. In particular,
this API is intended to cover the essentially needed for service delivery including by not limited to:

* Companies
* Contacts
* Devices
* Tickets

Functionality is intentionally limited to the scope of features needed/leveraged by the IVR Demo.

## Tech Stack

This service is implemented as a Python-based API service leveraging:

* FastAPI
* Pydantic
* SQLModel
